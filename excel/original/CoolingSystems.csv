Assumptions:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the UK, all heating is by gas boilers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In India, every household with air conditioning also has an air cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every household with an air cooler also has at least one fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Households with no fans have no 'cooling' technology at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The cooling output of the evaporative coolers and air conditioning are very approximate, as are the coefficients of refrigertion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In reality, evaporative coolers perform much less well in humid conditions but to model this would be beyond the scope of this model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
