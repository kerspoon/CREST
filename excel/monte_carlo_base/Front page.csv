,," - Bug fixed where very occasionally occupancy model would encounter an transition probability 'dead end' i.e. a row consisting of all zeros. This is likely an artefact caused by the fact that the time-use survey data starts and ends at 4am and has some occupancy states at the end of the survey that are not found at the beginning. Thanks to Simon Ruben Drauz at Fraunhofer for pointing this out.
",,,,,,,,
,," - Bug fixed in the Irradiance component. Previous versions stated the variables Go,clearsky and Go were clearsky and global radiation at surface horizontal, but were actually values for a plane tracking the sun. This has been fixed and has an impact of reducing passive solar gains in the building thermal model with a corresponding increase in thermal energy demands compared to previous versions of the model e.g. while the winter model dataset used for validation in the paper had an average daily gas demand of 54 kWh in the previous version, in the current version the average is 63 kWh for a similar winter dataset. This brings the model output closer in line with the validation datasets used in the paper and, overall, means the model is more representative. Thanks to Leon Hofmann and Russell McKenna at Karlsruhe Institute for Technology for identifying this bug.",,,,,,,,

,," - Standard deviation of random temperature variations increased to reflect the actual variation in daily temperatures, as seen in the Central England Temperature Record. This also varies with the month. ",,,,,,,,
,," - Create ambient temperatures based on a series of 12 monthly averages, not a sinusoidal approximation. The Indian temperature profiles are far from sinusoidal due to the late summer monsoon. ",,,,,,,,
,," - Add in the Local_Standard_Time_Meridian as an input (82.5 East for India, 0 for UK).  - Add in Daylight saving as an input (not used in India). Longitude and latitude are also used for solar irradiance, but the clearness model is unchanged for the moment.",,,,,,,,
,, - Change the types and numbers of appliances owned. Make this depend on the level of development by year and on urbanisation. The standby and operating loads of each appliance also change.,,,,,,,,
,," - The active occupancy model is unchanged from the UK: Despite the larger average household size in India, there is no evidence that an increased number of people per household leads to increased appliance use in India. The small amount of time-use data available for India suggests that overall active occupancy by time of day is not significantly different from the UK. 

",,,,,,,,
,," - Thermal characteristics of Indian houses approximated: 1. An appartment 2. A small single storey house. Thermal capacities and thermal insulation properties for each were copied from properties of UK homes as described by the Cambridge Housing Model, based on the English Housing Survey.",,,,,,,,
,," - A cooling model is now added, similar to the heating model but separate from it. Cooling options include fans, evaporative coolers and ful air conditioning. For the moment, the poor performance of evaporative coolers in conditions of high humidity is not modelled. Cooling energy is based on the 'main' cooling technology used, with air conditioning taking precedence over evaporative coolers, and coolers taking precedence over ceiling fans.",,,,,,,,
,," - Passive solar gains are adjusted downward for Indian houses to account for higher solar elevations and more shading over vertical windows and doors than in the UK.

",,,,,,,,
,," - A new heating option is added: Electric water heating only, with a small storage tank.",,,,,,,,
,, - The total electricity used in lighting is adjusted by scaling to that predicted for Indian households but the types of lightbulb have not changed. Future versions might adjust the number of lighting appliances and the power used per appliance considering the increasing use of compact fluorescents and LEDs.,,,,,,,,
,v2.3.1,"Corrected bug that was introduced with v2.3. The global clearness index, global irradiance and outdoor temperature were being recalculated for every dwelling in v2.3. In v2.3.1 these quanities are calculated once for all dwellings, as they were in v2.2.",2018-11-02 00:00:00,J.Barton,,,,,,
,v2.3.2,"In class clsPVSystem, subroutine CalculatePVOutput(): dblDayOfYear and dblLongitude are now set and correctly used. dblSolarIncidentAngle is now correctly calculated from the dot product of the solar beam angle and the normal to the panel.  The code now correctly detects whether the solar azimuth angle is acute or obtuse.  The number of minutes in an hour is now corrected from 59 to 60. ",2019-11-25 00:00:00,J.Barton,,,,,,
,,"In Class clcGlobalClimate, subroutine RunTemperatureModel: A workaround has been created for cases where the sun never rises above the horizon, for the Arctic or Antarctic winter. If kx_max is zero, it is now set to 1 to avoid a divide-by-zero. An artifical daily cycle of minimum and maximum temperature is also created for this situation. Outputs of the PV model and the Global Climate models now appear in a new worksheet called 'Irradiance'  ",,,,,,,,
,,"The model now works with the latest version of Excel and Windows 10. User problems with ""run-time error '1004': Method 'Range' of object '_Worksheet' failed"" may need to delete duplicate or older copies of Excel. The variable for daily average temperature now has a shorter name and has been converted from type 'Variant' to 'Double'. This may reduce the incident of error '1004'.",,,,,,,,
,v2.3.3,"In CalculateGlobalIrradiance, loop through minutes of each hour now corrected from 59 to 60.
In RunTemperatureModel, the calculation of cSolarConstant, the conversion to radians is removed because the angle equivalent of day-of-year is already calculated in radians.
In RunTemperatureModel, loop through the remaining minutes of the day was 2 To 1439, now 2 to 1440.",2020-05-06 00:00:00,J.Barton,,,,,,
